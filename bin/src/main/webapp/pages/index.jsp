			<p>In highly populated countries like India, food wastage is a disturbing issue. The streets, garbage bins and landfills have ample proof to prove it. Marriages, canteens, restaurants, social and family get-togethers and functions expel out so much food. Food wastage is not only an indication of hunger or pollution, but also of many economic problems. The high standard of living has resulted in the wastage of food, clothes, etc. because of quick changes in habits and lifestyle.</p>

			<p>Most people don't realize how much food they throw away every day â€” from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. About 95 percent of the food we throw away ends up in landfills or combustion facilities. In 2013, we disposed more than 35 million tons of food waste. Many people wish to donate things to needy organizations. Also, many organizations wish to ask for various things required by them such as clothes, food grains, books, utensils, etc., but there is no source available through which they can satisfy their requirements.</p>

			<p>Thereby, an Android application has been developed through which people can donate items as per their capacity and the application also allows organizations to put up their requests, i.e. items required by them, if any. The majority of the population today uses smartphones with active internet connection, which is the basic requirement for this product to function properly</p>

			<p>Instead of wasting these things we can put them in use by donating them to various organizations such as orphanages, old age homes, etc. The product is an internet-based android application that basically aims at charity through donations.</p>
